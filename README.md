- In **U**niversity of **N**evada, **L**as **V**egas
- Period: 2023.06.25 ~ 2023.07.23
- Project: Definition of scaleable machine learning for big data
- Description: Big data analytics provides scalable solutions for distributed or very large data. For this project, students will have hands-on experience installing Apache Spark, and practicing python libraries, e.g., MLLib, while applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to large datasets for data analysis and developing machine learning models.

## Required skills
- Understanding of MapReduce
- Machine learning
- Fundamental Python skills

## Weekly Plan
- Week 1: Intro Machine Learning
- Week 2: Semina about Spark[[slide]](https://github.com/riverallzero/UNLV-proj/blob/main/Week2(mon)-session.pdf) & choose dataset and subject for project
